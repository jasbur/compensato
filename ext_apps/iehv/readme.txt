Copyright (c) 2003 - 2011 Nir Sofer



Description
===========

Each time that you type a URL in the address bar or click on a link in
Internet Explorer browser, the URL address is automatically added to the
history index file. When you type a sequence of characters in the address
bar, Internet Explorer automatically suggests you all URLs that begins
with characters sequence that you typed (unless AutoComplete feature for
Web addresses is turned off). However, Internet Explorer doesn't allow
you to view and edit the entire URL list that it stores inside the
history file.

This utility reads all information from the history file on your
computer, and displays the list of all URLs that you have visited in the
last few days. It also allows you to select one or more URL addresses,
and then remove them from the history file or save them into text, HTML
or XML file. In addition, you are allowed to view the visited URL list of
other user profiles on your computer, and even access the visited URL
list on a remote computer, as long as you have permission to access the
history folder.

First Release



System Requirement
==================

This utility works on any version of Windows operating system with
Internet Explorer version 4.00 or greater.



Using IEHistoryView
===================

IEHistoryView is provided as standalone executable, so it doesn't require
any installation process or additional DLLs. Just copy the executable
(iehv.exe) to any folder you like, and run it.
After you run it, the main window displays the list of all URLs stored in
the history file of the current logged on user. If you want to view the
history information of other users on your computer, choose the "Select
User Profile" from the file menu, and select the desired user profile.
If you want to view the history information of another computer on a
network, connect to the desired network drive, and from the File menu,
choose "Select History Folder", and select the history folder in the
remote drive.



Notice: The Hits Column
=======================

Many poeple ask me about the meaning of the Hits column in the History
file of Internet Explorer. So here's a small explanation: Generally, the
Hits value should display the number of times that you visited the
specified URL. However, in many records, you may notice that when you
visit the URL, the number of hits grows by more than one. It might grow
by 2, 3, 5, or even 15.
I don't know the exact "formula" that Microsoft uses to calculate the
hits value. This means that you cannot use the Hits column to detemine
the exact number of times that you visited a Web site.



Notice: Time Zone
=================

When you use this tool to inspect the IE history of another computer, The
time zone settings of Windows (including Daylight saving time) in the
computer the runs IEHistoryView must be the same as the time zone
settings of the computer that created the history file. That's because
the Modified Time in some of the history records is saved in GMT, while
the Modified Time in other records is saved in local time, and
IEHistoryView has to correct the Modified Time according to the correct
time zone.



The Typed URLs List
===================

Most URLs that you visit are saved in the History folder. However,
Internet Explorer also saves the last 25 URLs that you typed in the
following Registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet
Explorer\TypedURLs
By default, IEHistoryView doesn't display the URLs list from the
Registry, but you can change this setting by choosing the "Display Typed
URLs" option under the View menu. If this option is selected, the URLs
list in the Registry are displayed, in addition to the list of all URLs
stored in the History folder. You can distinguish between the 2 types of
URLs by looking at the 'Hits' column or at the one of the dates columns.
As opposed to the URLs extracted from the History folder, The URLs from
the Registry doesn't provide any additional information except the URL
itself, so the other columns contains 'N/A' string (Not Available).
Be aware that the typed URLs list can only be displayed for your local
system. You cannot view the typed URLs list if choose to watch the
history data from another computer or from another operating system.



Deleting URLs From The History File
===================================

IEHistoryView allows you to delete URL items from the history file and
from the typed URLs list in the Registry. In order to that, select the
URLs that you want to delete, and press the Del key.



Viewing Older History Information
=================================

In some circumstances, Internet Explorer saves some older history
information in subfolders located under the main history folder. Starting
from version 1.20, you can view the history information stored in these
subfolders by using the 'Select History Subfolder' option in the File
menu.



About The History Folder
========================

The location of the history folder is different from one operating system
to another.
On Windows 98, the history folder is located under your Windows
directory. For example: If your Windows 98 is installed under c:\win98,
the history folder is c:\win98\history
On Windows 2000/XP, the History folder is located inside "Local Settings"
folder of your user profile. For Example: C:\Documents and
Settings\Administrator\Local Settings\History. The "Local Settings"
folder is hidden by default, so you won't see this folder unless your
system is configured to display hidden files and folders.
In most systems, IEHistoryView automatically identify your current
History folder and uses it as default. However, you can always select
History folder from another location by using the "Select History Folder"
option under the File menu.

Be aware that when you watch the History folder from Windows environment,
it doesn't show you the real files inside this folder, but instead it
displays the history shell extension that provides limited information
about the sites you visited.



Command-Line Options
====================

Syntax: iehv [/Action] ["Destination File"] {-Source Type} {"Source"}


[/Action] can be one of the following options:


/stext
Saves the URLs list into a text file specified in ["Destination File"]
parameter.

/stab
Saves the URLs list into tab-delimited text file specified in
["Destination File"] parameter.

/shtml
Saves the URLs list into HTML file specified in ["Destination File"]
parameter.

/sverhtml

["Destination File"] parameter.

/stabular
Saves the URLs list into tabular text file specified in ["Destination
File"] parameter.

/sxml
Saves the URLs list into xml file specified in ["Destination File"]
parameter.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "URL" and "Modified Date". You can specify the '~' prefix character
(e.g: "~Modified Date") if you want to sort in descending order. You can
put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple
columns.

Examples:
iehv.exe /shtml "f:\temp\iehv.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
iehv.exe /shtml "f:\temp\iehv.html" /sort "~Modified Date"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.

The {-Source Type} parameter is optional. If you don't specify it, the
URLs will be loaded from the default History folder on your system.
This parameter may contain one of the following values:


-folder
Loads the URLs list from the folder specified in {"Source"} parameter.

-user

Translating to other languages

IEHistoryView allows you to easily translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and
other strings to other languages.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:

   IEHistoryView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to the
   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run IEHistoryView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
