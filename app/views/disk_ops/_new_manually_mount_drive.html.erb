		<h1>Usage Tip:</h1>
		<p>Choose which drive you would live to mount as the client's drive by clicking on it. You will
			be redirected back to the main screen after the drive has been mounted. Use the size of the partition as an indicator of which to choose.
			Usually the largest will be the right choice.</p>
