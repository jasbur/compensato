	<h1>Usage Tip:</h1>

	<p>Use this test to test the reliability of the network hardware that this system is currently connected to. 
		This includes the network adapter (wired or wireless), the router, and (if you enter an external address) 
		the client's modem. If you'd like to stress test the network equipment pick an internal address, like the 
		router, and a very high ping count.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Address to ping:</b> This is where you want to send the data packets to. Choose an intenal address 
			like the client's router to test the health of internal equipment and choose an external address like 
			google.com to test the health of the connection after it leaves the building. (Some external addresses 
			will not support this test)</li></br>
		<li><b>Number to pings to send:</b> This is the number of pings, or packets, of data that you'd like to 
			send. A number that's too low will not give an accurate sample of the network's health and a number 
			too high will take a long time to finish. We recommend using <b>10,000</b> pings for an internal address 
			and	<b>2,000</b> to an external address (both tests should take about 30 seconds to complete at that 
			volume)</li>
	</ul>
