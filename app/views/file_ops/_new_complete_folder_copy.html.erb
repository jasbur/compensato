	<h1>Usage Tip:</h1>
	<p>This will copy all data and subdirectories from one place to another. This is typically used for 
		copy the user data directory to and from the client's computer. For now there are no browse buttons 
		but you can browse to each directory clicking the "Open file browser" link at the top of the page and 
		press CTRL-L on your keyboard, then just copy the path at the top of the window and paste it into 
		the appropriate box.</p>
		
		<p>We recommend using the C:\Compensato\Customer_Data directory on the client's 
		system which was automatically created when Compensato started to copy user data back to to if 
		you've just done a re-install. If you're copying data off to an external drive we highly recommend 
		having that drive formatted to EXT4 (thats'a common Linux filesystem) because the copy will go MUCH 
		faster. The external drive can be formatted with just about any filesystem though.</p>
