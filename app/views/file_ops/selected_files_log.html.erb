		<p>This is a list of just the files that you thought were suspicious from the previous 
			screen. From here you can take action to delete or quarantine these files outside 
			of this application using the built-in file browser on the left navigation bar. You 
			can also click the "Find all files modified on this date" link next to any of the 
			files to see a list of all files of any type modified on the client's system on 
			that date. This can be really useful for finding the intire scale of the infection. 
			A copy of this log has been saved on the client's drive at <b>C:\Compensato</b></p>
