    	<h1>Usage Tip:</h1>
		<p>This page lists all of the files (of the selected types) that have been modified in the 
			last <%=@scan_days%> days. Use the check boxes next any files that you think might look 
			suspicious and click the "Select files" button when you're done. The next page will 
			give you a nice isolated list of just those files for further examination. It will also 
			create a text log on the client's computer at C:\Compensato</p>
			
		<ul>	
			<li><b>Open in browser:</b> This will open the conatining folder of the selected file. Moving suspicious files to the (already created) 
				C:\Compensato\Quarantine folder on the client's	drive is a better choice than deleting them here because that can always be reversed</li>
		</ul>
